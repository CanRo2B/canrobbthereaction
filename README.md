Unit 20 REACT portfolio

## Product Description
The React Portfolio, could have been a lot of fun.  There are so many possibilities with React!  
The portfolio I created used react-router to navigate between the pages.  The main page shows the navigation bar that users can get to know a little more about me, my portfolio and the contact form.  The footer shows links to various accounts.
